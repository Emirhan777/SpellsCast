// Does the pointer hold still?  npm run test:tilt
//
// You cannot feel a jittery pointer from a unit test, but you can measure it.
// This drives a smooth, physical 40-degree swing through the real mapping in
// game/tilt.js and measures how far the on-screen point moves between
// consecutive samples. A smooth input must produce a smooth output; any single
// step much bigger than the average is a visible jump.
//
// Sensor noise is applied the physically right way: as a small random ROTATION
// of the device, after which the browser's own inverse formulas turn the rotation
// into alpha/beta/gamma. Adding noise to each angle independently looks similar
// and is wrong - it cannot reproduce how the angles misbehave near the poles.
//
// The mapping is PenDrawOnline's: alpha -> x, beta -> y. Its one known weakness
// is the phone standing dead upright, where beta = 90 degrees and alpha and gamma
// describe the same rotation, so alpha alone stops meaning anything. This test
// asserts the pointer is smooth in every pose you actually hold the phone in
// here - tipped back to look at the cast pad - and prints the upright numbers
// too, so the weakness stays on record instead of being forgotten.
